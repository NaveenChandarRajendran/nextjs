Nextjs - Is a framework for building superfast  & Search - engine friendly application.

It accepet both web browser and nodejs run time.

What is nodejs run time?
It is a engine which will execute javascript code in server.

We can do SSR(Server side rendering) and SSG(Static site generation)
SSR - It allows us to render our component on the server and send their content to the client.This is very fast.
SSG - The components which we have static data, we can re-render when we build (npm run build) our application,
we just render them once and serve them whenever needed.
